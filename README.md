# This repository implements the complete CARPOS system. 

The main objective of the CARPOS integrated system is to demonstrate the functionality, robustness, and adaptability of the integrated robotic framework, to evaluate its performance against the predefined Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), and to highlight its contribution to coachable, automated, flexible, and sustainable harvesting. In addition to presenting performance results. 



The research project "CARPOS - Coachable Robot for Fruit Picking Operations" is implemented in the framework of H.F.R.I call "Basic Research Financing (Horizontal support of all Sciences)" under the National Recovery and Resilience Plan "Greece 2.0" funded by the European Union – NextGenerationEU(H.F.R.I. Project Number: 16523).
